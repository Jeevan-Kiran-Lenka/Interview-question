# Interview-question
A repository intended to have dynamic, good interview questions from wide range of companies including FAANG and also not FAANG but more good than it

# Some tips:-
- **Actually do the problems**. This means writing the code and making it run. Getting stuck can be frustrating, but it's natural and the best way to learn.
- Time yourself. Candidates who solve interview problems quickly are more likely to cinch the interview.
- Think of edge cases and run your code through them. Some good edge cases might be the empty case, weird inputs, or a really large input.
- Once you've made sure your code passes all your tests, try explaining your algorithm to a colleague or friend.
- Share a problem/(also star and share this repo) to people you think might enjoy it, and discuss potential solutions with them.
